# GCHD-FlipnoteStudio

This project is going to be my attempt to port Flipnote Studio for the DSi to Windows (hopefully WINE too).

Anyways, this is __very__ far from done, please don't get hyped anytime soon.

I'm trying to make it look, and be exactly like Flipnote Studio on the DSi.

However, once it's 100% completed (which will take forever), I might add some extra "advanced" features in the settings.

Anyways, don't get hyped, i'll start posting commits once I have something worthy here.
